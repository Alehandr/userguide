# What is Kohana?

Kohana is an [object oriented](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Programming) [MVC](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–View–Controller "Model View Controller") [web framework](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Framework) built using [PHP5](http://php.net/manual/intro-whatis "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor") that aims to be swift, secure, and small.

Kohana is open source software developed by a team of volunteers and released under the [new BSD license](http://kohanaphp.com/license). You can legally use Kohana for any kind of open source, commercial, or personal project.

## What makes Kohana great?

Anything can be extended using the unique [filesystem](general.filesystem) design, little or no [configuration](general.configuration) is necessary, [error handling](debugging.errors) helps locate the source of errors quickly, and [debugging](debugging.overview) and [profiling](debugging.profiling) provide insight into the application.

To help secure your applications, tools for [XSS removal](security.xss), [input validation](security.validation), [signed cookies](security.cookies), [form](security.forms) and [HTML](security.html) generators are all included. The [database](security.database) layer provides protection against [SQL injection](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Injection). Of course, all official code is carefully written and reviewed for security.
